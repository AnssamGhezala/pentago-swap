# pentago-swap
This is my Pentago Swap algorithm for the COMP424 AI course. 
- "Pentago-Swap" is a variant of the popular game "Pentago" where you are allowed to swap the board quarters.
- I was responsible for implementing the AI agent that plays against a RandomPlayer or other players at Pentago Swap.

You can run it on Eclipse and enjoy the game!
